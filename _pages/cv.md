## Work Experience
* Sep 2019 to Present: **Machine Learning Engineer**
  * Fusemachines, Nepal
  * **Projects**:
    * **(Current) Sex Trafficking Recognition from Escort Ads and Inter-Ad Matching** - working on image trafficking tags,
    multi-domain learning (text and image) for trafficking recognition, and similar image search and face based person matching
    * **Action Recognition Project** - built custom object detection architecture by fusing SSD, mobilenet architecture and focal loss,
    and fused across frames to identify the type of waste and the intent of person to throw in the dustbin
    * **2D X-ray Images to 3D CT Scan Estimation** - worked on articulation localization, registration and tuning conversion pipeline
    * **Session-based Network Intrusion Detection System** - feasibility test on the use of AutoEncoder based semi-supervised learning
    for network anomaly detection

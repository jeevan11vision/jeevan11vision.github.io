###  Human Trafficking Recognition from Sex Worker Ads and Inter-Ad Matching, Fusemachines
- Served as Team Lead, overseeing the design of the machine learning pipeline and the establishment of the data annotation process.
- Executed the implementation of a contrastive loss-based image search tailored for inter-ad matching, face-based person identification and models for image-based and text-based trafficking recognition, and NER-based social handle extraction.

### Analysis of Radio Panelists Data, Fusemachines
- As Team Lead, led analysis into the impact of song quality, commercial length, and time of day on panelists, employing custom metrics and statistical tests to assess song quality.
- Designed and implemented a data pipeline to enhance and augment existing datasets.

### Waste Type Detection, Fusemachines
- Developed a tailored object detection system by integrating SSD and MobileNet architecture with focal loss to determine the type of waste and the intent of the person disposing of it.

### Session-based Network Intrusion Detection System, Fusemachines
- Performed a feasibility study on utilizing AutoEncoder-based semi-supervised learning for network anomaly detection, leveraging session data extracted from pcap files.

### Nepali License Plate Recognition, Final Year Undergraduate Project
- Developed and executed a license plate recognition system tailored for Nepali license plates, encompassing three key stages: vehicle detection, license plate localization, and an OCR system focusing on Nepali characters.
- Created a license plate localization dataset specific to Nepali license plates through manual annotation, alongside crafting a Nepali character classification dataset by extracting alphabets and numbers from Devanagiri fonts.

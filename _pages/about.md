I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Fusemachines, Nepal. I have a wide experience of working on industry level Machine Learning projects. Also, I have taught an undergraduate course on "Mathematics for AI" from Jan 2021 to June 2021.


### Research Interests
* **Computer Vision**: Object Detection, Segmentation, Re-identification, Tracking, Action Recognition
* **Machine Learning**: Model Interpretability, Robustness, Self-Supervised Learning, Generative Modeling, Multi-modal Learning
* **Application**: Video/Image Analysis and Understanding, Medical Imaging

### Projects
* **(Current) Sex Trafficking Recognition from Escort Ads and Inter-Ad Matching**
  * working on image trafficking tags, multi-domain learning (text and image) for trafficking recognition, and similar image search and face based person matching
  

* **Action Recognition Project**
  * built custom object detection architecture by fusing SSD, mobilenet architecture and focal loss, and fused across frames to identify the type of waste and the intent of person to throw in the dustbin


* **2D X-ray Images to 3D CT Scan Estimation** 
  * worked on articulation localization, registration and tuning conversion pipeline


* **Session-based Network Intrusion Detection System** 
  * feasibility test on the use of AutoEncoder based semi-supervised learning for network anomaly detection


* **Nepali License Plate Recognition**, College Major Project
  * designed and implemented LPR system involving - vehicle  detection, license plate localization (ResNet-18), and a Nepali character-based OCR
  * created a license plate localization dataset for Nepali license plates by annotating 8000+ vehicle images and a Nepali OCR dataset by extracting alphanumeric characters from Devanagiri fonts


* **Online Auction System with Recommendation Engine**, College Minor Project
  * collaborated in E-commerce based auction system, for the online auctioning of goods with a recommendation engine, built using Weighted Alternating Least Squares (WALS) algorithm


* **Multi Person Tracking**
  * developed a multi-person tracking system consisting of a RetinaNet based person detector, a Siamese-based person embedding model (trained on MARS dataset) and Kalman filter
